Pipeline TD Code-Samples
=====================

(Python)


These code samples are provided mainly to support my resume but if you are a developer using the Shotgun production database you may find something here to spur your interest.

For more information, including movies of the code in action please see the GitHub pages here: http://projectguerilla.github.io/Code-Samples/

I've also got a couple of simple tools/examples that I wish I had access to when I first started working with Shotgun in my Shotgun-Code-Snippets repo (https://github.com/ProjectGuerilla/Shotgun-Code-Snippets)
